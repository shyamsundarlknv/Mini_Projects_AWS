# Then open ubuntu machine:
# Install MySQL Client:

# Connect to Your RDS Instance:
mysql -h your-rds-endpoint -P 3306 -u admin -p  #(Replace your-rds-endpoint) / EX: mysql -h my-rds-db.cj6wgoqmm0gw.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -P 3306 -u admin -p)

#First, you need to select the database you want to work with:
USE mydatabase;    #This command tells MySQL to set mydatabase as the current database. You should see a confirmation message that the database has been changed.

# Next, you can create a table called users with the following structure:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);


#id: An integer that auto-increments with each new record, acting as the primary key.
#username: A VARCHAR field with a maximum length of 50 characters, and it cannot be null.
#email: A VARCHAR field with a maximum length of 100 characters, and it cannot be null.
#created_at: A TIMESTAMP field that automatically sets the current timestamp when a new record is inserted.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Now, insert a sample record into the users table:
INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('john_doe', 'john@example.com');

# To see the data you've just inserted, run:
SELECT * FROM users;

# Update Data / If you need to update the email of the user john_doe, use the following command:
UPDATE users SET email = 'john.doe@example.com' WHERE username = 'john_doe';

# To see the data you've just inserted, run:
SELECT * FROM users;

#  Delete Data
DELETE FROM users WHERE username = 'john_doe';
